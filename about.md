My name is Nico Lueg and I'm 22 years old.
I recently finished my bachelor's degree at the [Technical University in Dortmund](https://tu-dortmund.de/en/) in December 2019.
Soon, I will start with my master's degree at the [FernUniversit√§t in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/english/).

Since January 2016 I have also been working at the [BROCKHAUS AG](https://www.brockhaus-ag.de/) as a software developer alongside my university.
During this time I have already gained experience in various projects.
After my bachelor's degree, I started to work there as an IT-Consultant.

At present, I already worked with a few programming languages.
I used Java, TypeScript, and C# most of the time.
But I want to explore new languages so that I can solve problems even better.

On this blog, I want to share a few thoughts of myself and the experiences that I made.
I want to concentrate the postings on programming languages and technology in general.
I aim to post a new entry like once a month.
