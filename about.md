My name is Nico Lueg and I'm 22 years old.
I am studying computer science in my sixth semester. I am currently working on my bachelor's degree at the [Technical University in Dortmund](https://tu-dortmund.de/en/) and will finish the degree at the end of the year. Then I will start with my master's degree at the [FernUniversit√§t in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/english/).

Since January 2016 I have also been working at the [BROCKHAUS AG](https://www.brockhaus-ag.de/) as a software developer alongside my university. 
During this time I have already gained experience in various projects.

At present, I already worked with a few programming languages.
I used Java, TypeScript and C# most of the time.
But I want to explore new languages so that I can solve problems even better.

On this blog, I want to share a few thoughts of myself and the experiences that I made.
I want to concentrate the postings on programming languages and technology in general. 
I aim to post a new entry every one or two weeks.
