With Pantrist you never lose track of your supplies and your purchases.

Even before you go shopping, you can clearly categorize the products to enable efficient purchasing.
While shopping, the items can be stored in the stocks, if required with the entry of the best-before date.

On the start page you can see the products that are about to expire so that you can consume them first.

For certain items, a minimum stock level can also be set. When a product is taken out of stock, the item is automatically added to the shopping list. In this way, the stocks are always maintained.

You can share your lists with friends, your partner or your flat share!
